# TODO: Copy your Robot class from Part I here (do not fill in solutions).

# TODO: Define a function to generate a grid of size N x N (as a 2D list)
#       Each cell should be "." to start with

# TODO: Use random functions to place trees ("T") and rocks ("R") at random positions on the grid

# TODO: Write a loop to repeatedly:
#   1. Print the grid (mark robot with "X" at its position)
#   2. Print the robot's position
#   3. Get a move command from the user (up/down/left/right or quit)
#   4. (No need for collision yetâ€”that's Part III)
#   5. Update the robot's position based on the command

# TODO: End the loop if the user types "quit"
