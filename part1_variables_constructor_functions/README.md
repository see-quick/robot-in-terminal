# Part I: Variables, Constructors, and Functions/Methods

## Goal
Learn how to use variables, constructors, and basic methods in a Python class.

## Steps
1. Define a `Robot` class with a constructor (`__init__`) that sets `x` and `y` position variables.
2. Add a `position()` method that returns the current (x, y) as a tuple.
3. Add a `print_position()` method to print the robot's position in a friendly way.
4. (Challenge) Add a `set_position(new_x, new_y)` method to move the robot.

## Example Output

Robot is at position (0, 0)
Robot is at position (2, 3)
Directly from position(): (2, 3)

## Stretch Goals
- Let the user enter the starting position using `input()`.
- Add another method, like `reset()` to send the robot back to (0, 0).
